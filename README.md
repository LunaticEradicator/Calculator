# Calculator
Simple Calculator created using HTML, CSS, JS

1, Took 1-2 week for a simple Calculator logic
2, Took 1 Whole month for this project
3, The whole logic was that, I didn't need to store value in two different variable but had to make textOne = textTwo [through for loop, addEventListener]
4, I tried to make textTwo from current.textContent [Dump decision need to think more logically and create better problem solving skill]
5, Also need to create a sign variable so that when we press equal button we can search for that sign and do the appropriate sign calculation
6, Also calculating without Equal sign with it's continuos calculating was also challenging. Had to do a lot of console logging and trouble-shooting for it 
7, For clearing reload the page a quick fix.
8, Simple CSS Hover effect and transition was used.
