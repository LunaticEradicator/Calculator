**1, Info**

An online calculator used to perform calculations, ranging from basic arithmetic to complex mathematics.

    1, The whole logic was that, I didn't need to store value in two different variable but had to make textOne = textTwo [through for loop, addEventListener].
    2, I tried to make textTwo from current.textContent [ Bad decision making, need to think more logically and create better problem solving skill ].
    3, Also need to create a sign variable so that when the equal button is pressed user can search for that sign and do the appropriate sign calculation.
    4, Also calculating without Equal sign with it's continuos calculating was also challenging. Had to do a lot of console logging and trouble-shooting for it.
    5, Simple CSS Hover effect and transition was used.
